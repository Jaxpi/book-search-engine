## Description

This application allows a user to sign-in and search books using Googles book api. The user can then add selected books to their list for reference when they are ready to purchase.

## Usage

The user creates an account by entering a username, email address, and password. They then enter the title of the books they would like to view in the search field. The api will display a list of related book titles for the user to select from. The user clicks on the "save this book!" button and the book will be added to their list. When they click on "see your books" from the main menu they are presented with the list of their saved books.
